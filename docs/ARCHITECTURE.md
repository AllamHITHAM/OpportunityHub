# OpportunityHub System Architecture

## Architecture Style

The project follows a layered architecture.

```

# Main Layers

## Flutter

Responsibilities:
- User Interface
- API Requests
- Authentication Token Storage
- Navigation

Flutter never talks directly to the database.

---

## Laravel REST API

Responsibilities:

- Authentication
- Validation
- Business Logic
- Authorization
- Database Communication

All requests pass through Laravel.

---

## Controllers

Responsibilities:

- Receive HTTP requests
- Validate requests
- Call Models or Services
- Return JSON responses

Controllers should stay small.

---

## Models

Each table has one Eloquent Model.

Examples:

- User
- StudentProfile
- CompanyProfile
- Skill
- Opportunity
- Application

Models define relationships.

---

## Database

MySQL stores all application data.

Tables are created only using Laravel Migrations.

Never manually create tables in phpMyAdmin.

---

## Authentication

Authentication will use Laravel Sanctum.

Every protected API requires authentication.

---

## File Uploads

CVs

Profile Images

Company Logos

will be stored using Laravel Storage.

---

## AI Module

The first version uses rule-based matching.

Future versions may integrate LLM APIs.

---

## Notifications

Notifications are stored in the database.

Flutter will fetch them through REST API.
